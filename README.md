This program allows the user to choose which pet they interact with: a hedgehog or an orca. They can play with the pet, which increases the happiness and hunger level of that animal. They can also choose to feed the pet, which decreases their hunger level. The program implements serialization, so each pet's state is saved for future runs. This program also includes a jar file, which was my first experience working with those.
